            General Radahn is one of the most respected demigods in Elden Ring. He's renowned as one of the Lands Between's finest soldiers and generals, ruling his own fief of Caelid. He's also a scholar and a sorcerer, versed enough in gravity magic to combat the stars. However, Radahn has fallen far by the time of Elden Ring.(https://www.cbr.com/every-demigod-elden-ring-explained/)
